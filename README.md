# HybridQE

This repository is created for the implementation of the paper Hybrid Query Answering over Incomplete Text-Labeled Graph Databases.

## 1. Datasets Preparation

We introduce two benchmarks for the task of hybrid query answering over incomplete semi-structured database, ProdHybridQA and BioHybridQA, which are derived from real-world e-commerce and protein-disease data. The hybrid queries can be downloaded via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EZKTx2YuEnEPXsxm5bMEqvGH8MMKOmjw?usp=drive_link).

## 2. Environment Requirement
- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.7
- tqdm

## 3. Reproduce the Results of HybridQE
Here we display the commands for reproducing the results of HybridQE on
